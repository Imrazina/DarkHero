 üìñ About the Game:
-------------------------------
Dark Hero is a 2D action roguelike game featuring procedural level generation with branching paths, puzzle-like mechanics, and parallel world switching.  
The player explores dynamically generated levels, collects loot, interacts with various NPCs through branching dialogues, and fights a boss guarding the final exit.

The project was developed as a semester assignment for university and is designed for easy extension thanks to its 
modular structure and prefab-based implementation for levels, loot, and enemies.
